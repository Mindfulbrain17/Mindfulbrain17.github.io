This is the front page of my personal website — a clean, minimal, and structured space where I share what I’m learning, building, experimenting with, and discovering. I’m **Anant Goyal**, a student currently preparing for **JEE Mains & Advanced**, and someone who enjoys studying deeply, building small but meaningful tech projects, and keeping my life organized with clarity and intention.

This site is meant to serve as my public notebook: a place where I write study notes, document learning, publish small automation projects, and reflect on personal growth, discipline, and the systems that help me stay consistent. It is built using the Academic Pages / Minimal Mistakes Jekyll framework and hosted freely on GitHub Pages — because simplicity + structure = focus.

About Me
======
My name is **Anant Goyal**, also known online as **mindfulbrain**. I am a focused and disciplined JEE aspirant who values clean systems, good manners, consistency, and clarity in learning. Beyond academics, I enjoy coding, writing, dancing, minimal design, and improving myself across all aspects of life.

Below is a little more about who I am and what I enjoy.

### 🎓 What I’m currently doing
- Preparing for **JEE Mains & Advanced** (Arjuna 1.0 batch)
- Actively writing and organizing subject-wise notes (Math, Physics, Chemistry)
- Studying **GOC from SKM sir** and refining conceptual understanding
- Building small coding projects using **Python, GitHub Actions, Telegram Bot API**
- Experimenting with minimalist web-design and digital note organization

### 💡 Why I built this website
This website exists because:
1. **Writing clarifies thinking.** Explaining concepts and problems helps me understand them deeply.
2. **A clean archive is priceless.** Study notes, projects, experiment logs, and solved problems should live in one tidy, searchable, easy-to-maintain place.
3. **Small projects add up.** Coding bots, automation scripts, dashboards, and experiments make me stronger as a learner and a problem-solving thinker.
4. **Digital discipline matters.** A personal website is a structured reflection of a structured mind.

### 🧠 Interests & subjects I post about
- JEE Mathematics (notes, formula sheets, solved problems)
- Physics derivations, graphs (e.g., capacitor charging/discharging), and conceptual notes
- Organic Chemistry (GOC reaction logic, mechanisms, and shortcuts)
- Experiments I conduct (rainwater pH project, biodegradable segregation study, etc.)
- Personal productivity systems and digital organization
- Coding projects, GitHub notes, simple automation and scripts

Projects & Learning
======
I love building small, efficient tools that automate repetitive tasks or organize information better.

### 📌 Medication Reminder Telegram Bot
A fully automated reminder bot that sends scheduled messages daily.  
- Built with **Python**, **Telegram Bot API**, **GitHub Actions**
- Uses **GitHub Secrets** for secure token management  
- Handles time-zone conversion and cron scheduling in UTC  
- Debugged issues like delayed messages, multiple triggers, and job clustering

### 📌 PKM Dashboard (v0)
A dark-mode-first personal knowledge management dashboard prototype with:  
- Pages for books, movies, dream buys, notes  
- LocalStorage-based persistence  
- Structured lists and minimal UI  

### 📌 Domains & basic web building
- Purchased & configured **akhiltraders.in**  
- Learning Jekyll, custom Markdown structures, and GitHub Pages deployment  
- Understanding minimal UI design & typography

Hobbies & Personal Notes
======
Life isn’t only about studying — here’s what else I enjoy:

- **Reading non-fiction:** 13–15 books done; currently reading *Shoe Dog*  
- **Dancing:** I love choreographing and performing at family weddings  
- **Skincare & grooming:** Using Zentox anti-acne serum, Cetaphil Oily Cleanser  
- **Clean dressing:** Smart casual fits, blazers, high-necks, and tidy outfits  
- **Coding for fun:** Bots, small tools, automations  
- **Friendships:** I value good manners, apologies, trust, and respect in relationships
